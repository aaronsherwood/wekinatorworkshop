# Wekinator Workshop

A quick introduction to machine learning using Wekinator and Processing. In the workshop we'll use Wekinator, Processing, and a webcam to create gestural interfaces for making music.

## Requirements
* [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/)
* [Processing](https://processing.org/)
  * Libraries used:
    * oscP5
    * OpenCV for Processing
    * Minim

## Workshop Outline
* Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforcment Learning
* [Weka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weka_(machine_learning))
* Classification
* Regression
* Performances

## Sounds
All the sound file loops included were donwloaded from [http://looperman.com](http://looperman.com/loops). Each loop is 120bpm. Download more loops from there, at that speed, or morph them to be at that speed, and exchange them in the Processing sketches if you like.
