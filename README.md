# Wekinator Examples

A quick introduction to machine learning using Wekinator and Processing.

## Requirements
Download Wekinator and Processing. Install the necessary libraries in Processing by going to Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library
* [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/)
* [Processing](https://processing.org/)
  * Libraries:
    * oscP5
    * OpenCV for Processing
    * Minim

## Sounds
All the sound file loops included were downloaded from [http://looperman.com](http://looperman.com/loops). Each loop is 120bpm. Download more loops from there, at that speed, or morph them to be at that speed, and exchange them in the Processing sketches if you like. To be used in Processing they need to be mono, not stereo.
